    "Datasets can be categorized in several ways based on their structure, usage, and the types of data they contain. Here's a breakdown of some common categorizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Based on Structure:**\n",
    "   - **Structured Data:**\n",
    "     - Data organized in rows and columns, such as spreadsheets or databases (e.g., CSV files, SQL tables).\n",

    "     - Examples: Text (documents, social media posts), images, audio, and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Semi-Structured Data:**\n",
    "     - Data that doesn't strictly follow a tabular format but has some level of organization (e.g., XML, JSON).\n",
    "     - Examples: Log files, web data (HTML), NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Based on Content Type:**\n",

    "     - Datasets with a manageable number of samples.\n",
    "     - Example: Simple datasets with a few hundred rows like basic survey data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Big Data:**\n",
    "     - Datasets too large or complex for traditional data processing tools to handle.\n",
    "     - Example: Data collected from sensors in IoT devices, social media activity logs.\n",
    "\n",

However, simply decrementing `i` inside the loop (`i -= 1`) won't work because the `for` loop in Python automatically reassigns `i` to the next value in the `range` at the start of each iteration. This means your modification of `i` inside the loop is overwritten.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Instance Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Instance variables are variables that are specific to an instance (an object) of a class. They are defined inside the `__init__` method or any other method that operates on an instance.\n",
    "- **Scope**: The scope of an instance variable is limited to the instance (object) of the class.\n",
    "- **Accessed via**: `self.<variable>`\n",
    "- **Usage**: Instance variables store data that is unique to each object created from a class.\n",

    "### 5. **Enclosing (Nonlocal) Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Enclosing variables (also known as nonlocal variables) are variables in the scope of an enclosing (outer) function. These variables are neither global nor local but are in a containing function.\n",
    "- **Scope**: The scope of enclosing variables is within the outer function but accessible to nested (inner) functions.\n",
    "- **Accessed via**: `nonlocal <variable>`\n",
    "- **Usage**: Enclosing variables allow nested functions to modify variables in the outer function using the `nonlocal` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer():\n",
    "    count = 0  # Enclosing variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def inner():\n",
    "        nonlocal count  # Accessing and modifying the enclosing variable\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "        print(count)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    inner()  # Outputs: 1\n",
    "    inner()  # Outputs: 2\n",
    "\n",

    "### 6. **Built-in Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Built-in variables are predefined variables and functions that Python provides by default. These are part of Python’s built-in namespace and are available globally in every Python program.\n",
    "- **Scope**: The scope of built-in variables is the entire program (globally accessible).\n",
    "- **Accessed via**: Directly, without needing to import them.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Built-in variables include functions, exceptions, and data types, like `len()`, `abs()`, `min()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(len)  # Outputs: <built-in function len>\n",
    "print(abs(-5))  # Outputs: 5 (abs is a built-in function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**:\n",
    "- Built-in variables and functions are available globally in Python.\n",
    "- You don’t need to define or import them—they are part of Python’s standard library.\n",
