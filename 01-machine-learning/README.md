## 5 Python Libraries for Lazy Data Scientists 

### 🚀 SweetViz: EDA on Autopilot 

Compare datasets, uncover patterns, and generate stunning reports in seconds

🔹 Generates interactive, shareable HTML reports
🔹 Highlights missing values and feature distributions
🔹 Automatically detects correlations and key insights
🔹 Compares datasets side by side for quick validation

pip install sweetviz

⚡ Pandas Profiling: Full Data Summary in One Command 

Forget running 20+ pandas functions—this tool does it all at once

🔹 Full statistical summary in one command
🔹 Detects missing values, correlations, distributions
🔹 Works with large datasets without manual adjustments
🔹 Computes statistics, distributions, and missing values automatically

pip install pandas-profiling

### 🎯 LazyPredict: Rapid Model Benchmarking 

Skip the tedious coding—test multiple ML models at once

🔹 Runs dozens of models with a single command
🔹 Saves time by automating baseline comparisons
🔹 Helps identify the best starting point for fine-tuning
🔹 Generates a ranked leaderboard of model performance

pip install lazypredict

🛠️ FLAML:  Automated Model Tuning & Selection 

Optimizes both model selection and hyperparameters—no manual tweaking needed

↳ Just set how long you want it to run, and it'll figure out the best model setup without you having to mess around with the details.

pip install flaml

### 🤖 PyCaret: End-to_End ML Automation 

From data prep to deployment, PyCaret streamlines the entire ML pipeline.

🔹 Provides built-in model comparison and evaluation
🔹 Handles missing values, outliers, and transformations
🔹 Automates feature engineering, model selection, tuning
🔹 Supports deployment-ready pipelines with minimal effort

Pro Tip: These tools speed up your workflow, but learning the manual process will make you a true data science pro!
