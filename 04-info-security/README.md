### Case Exercise
The next day at SLS(Secure Login System) found everone in technical support busy restoring computer system to their former state and installing new virus and worm control software. Amy found herself learning how to re-install desktop computer operating system and applications as SLS made a heric effor to recover from the attack of the pervious day.

- Discussion Questions
1. Do you think this event was caused by insider or outsider?
2. Other than installing virus and worm control software, what can SLS do to prepare for the next incident?
3. Do you think this attack was the result of a virus or a worm?


### Case Example
Ethical Decision making often an attacker crafts e-mail attacks containing malware designed to take advantage of the curiosity or even greed of the recipients. Imagine that the message body Amy saw on the email from Davey had been "See our manager" salaries and SSNs (Social Security Number) instead of "Funniest joke you'll see today"

1. Would it be ethical for Amy to open such a file?
2. If such an email came in, what would be the best action to take.
