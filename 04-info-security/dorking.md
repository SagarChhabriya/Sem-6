# Dorking on GitHub

## 1. Look for Exposed API Keys in Any Code File

```py
site:github.com inurl:"/blob/" "api_key" OR "apiKey"
```
- `/blob/` is a strong indicator you're inside a GitHub code file, not a repo homepage.

## 2. Raw Format Leaks (Indexed by Google)
```py
site:githubusercontent.com "api_key=" OR "SECRET_KEY="
```

- `githubusercontent.com` is the domain GitHub uses to serve raw code files.
- This hits raw code directly, not GitHubâ€™s web interface.


## 3. Search for Firebase or Google API Keys
```py
site:github.com inurl:"/blob/" "AIzaSy"
```

## 4. Search for Tokens or Secrets
```py
site:github.com inurl:"/blob/" "token=" OR "auth_token=" OR "secret="
```

## 5. API Keys from Only Python projects
```py
site:github.com inurl:"/blob/" "api_key=" filetype:py
```

- **Or only .env secrets:**
```py
site:github.com inurl:"/blob/" "DB_PASSWORD=" filetype:env
```

## 6. LinkedIn 
```py
site:linkedin.com intitle:afiniti "Data"
```

## 7. Confidential Files
```py
filetype:pdf intitle:"Confidential" site: edu.pk
```

## 8. Passwords
```py
intitle: "index of" password
```


```py
intitle:"index of " "*.passwords.txt"
```


## 10. Exposed Webcams
```py
"WebcampXP"
```

## 11. DB Password
```py
db_password filetype:env
```
