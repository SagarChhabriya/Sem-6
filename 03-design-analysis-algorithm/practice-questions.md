Which of the following problem can be solved using exhaustive search?
Sorting an array
Finding the shortest path
The Traveling Salesman Problem
Matrix Multiplication

ChatGPT said:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) can be solved using exhaustive search (also known as brute force). Here's an explanation for each option:

Sorting an array:

Exhaustive search is not used to solve sorting problems. Sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort are typically used, which are more efficient than an exhaustive approach.

Finding the shortest path:

Exhaustive search could be used to find the shortest path, but more efficient algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford, or A* search are usually preferred for this problem. Exhaustive search (like trying all possible paths) would be inefficient, especially for large graphs.

The Traveling Salesman Problem:

Exhaustive search can solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by trying all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total travel distance for each. This is a brute-force approach, but it is computationally expensive, with a time complexity of O(n!). While not efficient for large instances, it is a valid approach for solving the TSP.

Matrix Multiplication:

Exhaustive search is not a typical method for matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is usually done using efficient algorithms like the standard matrix multiplication algorithm (O(nÂ³)) or Strassen's algorithm, which reduce the computational complexity compared to an exhaustive search.

Conclusion:
The Traveling Salesman Problem can be solved using exhaustive search (brute force), though it's not efficient for large datasets. The other problems can be solved using more optimized approaches.
